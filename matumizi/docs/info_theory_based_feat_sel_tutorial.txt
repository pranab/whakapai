This tutorial is for information theory based feature selection  a loan application data set. The 
implementation is the python package matumizi

Setup
=====
Install matumizi as follows
pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ matumizi==0.0.5

Install requirements
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Generate loan application data
==============================
python3 fesel.py --op gen --nloan 2000 --noise .05 --klen 10 > lo.txt

where
op = operation to perform
nloan = num of loans
noise = noise level
klen = loan ID length

Options for "op" (featute selection techniques)
mrmr 	- Max relevance min redundancy
jmi		- Joint mutual information
cmim	- Conditional mutual information maximization
icap 	- Interaction capping
infg	- Information gain

Feature selection
=================
python3 fesel.py --op fsel --fpath lo.txt --algo mrmr

where
op = operation to perform
fpath = path to file containing loan data
algo = feature selection algorithm (mrmr, jmi, cmim, icap)
