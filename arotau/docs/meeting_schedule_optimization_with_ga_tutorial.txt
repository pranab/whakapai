This tutorial is for optimum meeting schedules for meetings in week using genetic algorithms, given 
the number of meetings  and participants in those meeting. More fragmented the the free blocks of time
in betwwen higher the cost in the optimizer.


Setup
=====
Install matumizi which is a package for data exploration and various other utilities
pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ matumizi==0.0.3

Install heuristic optimization package arotau
pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ arotau==0.0.1

It's recommended that you copy msched.py  to a working directory and work 
from there. 


Running the iptimizer
=====================
python3 mesched.py  --cfpath mesched.properties --nmeeting 15 --npeople 10

cfpath = config file path
nmeeting = number of ameetings in a week
npeople = number of people

Make sure the following configuration is set as below
opti.solution.size=x
where x = 3 * num_meetings
