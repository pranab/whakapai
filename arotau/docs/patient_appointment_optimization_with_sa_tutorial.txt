This tutorial is for optimizing patient appointments in a doctor's office  using simulated annealing.


Setup
=====
Install matumizi which is a package for data exploration and various other utilities
pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ matumizi==0.0.4

Install heuristic optimization package arotau
pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ arotau==0.0.2

It's recommended that you copy doappt.py  to a working directory and work 
from there. 

Generate patient IDs
====================
python3 doappt.py --op gpid --npat 50 > pid.csv

npat = no of patients requesting appointment (20-80% more than 32)

Running the iptimizer
=====================
python3 doappt.py --op opt --pidfpath pid.csv --cfpath doappt.properties

pidfpath = patient ID file path
cfpath = config file path

Make sure the following configuration is set as below
