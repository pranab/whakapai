This tutorial is for online advertisement placement using Linear Upper Confidence Boumd (LinUCB)
contextual banditr algorithm

Setup
=====
Install matumizi which is a package for data exploration and various other utilities
pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ matumizi==0.0.8

Install reinforcement learning package qinisa
pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ qinisa==0.0.3

It's recommended that you copy adpl.py  to a working directory and work  from there. Make sure the 
sub directories "model", "app" and "log" exist under the working directory

Run first time
==============
python3 ./adpl.py --algo linucb --nads 5 --nsites 10 --nplay 50 --ntplay 500 --reg 5.0 --pthresh .05  --savefp ./model/linucb.mod

where
algo = contextual bandit algorithm
nads = number of advertisements 
nsites = num of web sites
nplay = num of plays in this session i.e num of iterations
ntplay = total num of plays aka time horizon
reg = ridge regression regularizer
pthresh = probability threshold
savefp = file wehere  linUCB model will be saved

At the end of the session the model  and related data is checkpointed

Running subsequently
==================== 
python3 ./adpl.py --algo linucb  --nplay 50 --ntplay 500  --savefp ./model/linucb.mod --restorefp ./model/linucb.mod

where
savefp = file wehere  linUCB model will be saved
restorefp = file from wehere linUCB model will be restored

At the end of the session an updated  model  and related data is checkpointed

Output
======
Here is some sample console output
