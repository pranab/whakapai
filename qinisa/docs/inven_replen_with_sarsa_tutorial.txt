This tutorial is for store inventory replenishment  usingusing TD Sarsa reinforcement learning algorithm

Setup
=====
Install matumizi which is a package for data exploration and various other utilities
pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ matumizi==0.0.8

Install reinforcement learning package qinisa
pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ qinisa==0.0.4

It's recommended that you copy invrepl.py  to a working directory and work  from there. Make sure the 
sub directories "model", "log" exist under the working directory

Run policy improvement RL
=========================
./invrepl.py --algo sarsa --ndays 3000 --lrate 0.25 --dfactor 0.9 --eps 0.5 --eprpol stepred --eprp .0001

where
algo = TD algorithm to run
lrate = learning rate 
dfactor = discount factor
eps = epsilon in random greedy bandit
eprpol = epsilon reduction policy with values stepred, linear, logLinear
eprp = epsilon step reduction value
