This tutorial is  for markov chain based anomaly detection in time series data. ECG data is used as an example.
A condition known as Attrial Fibrillation is simulated as anomaly.

Setup
=====
Install the package zaman
pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ zaman==0.0.2

For local build and istallation run this from the repo root directory whakapi
./lbi.sh zaman

Install dependencies, by running this from the package root directory
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Data generattion
================
The module tsgen is is used for synthetic time series generation. This module supports various kinds of time series
data generation. We will be using motif based time series generation. You define a motif with a set of points. It repeated 
with some random noise added

Generate normal data for training
Make sure window size is window.size is 200000 or more
Run
python3 tsgend.py --op motif  --cfpath tsgen_test.properties --ovcfpath tsgen_ecg.properties --nplots -1 > ecgt.csv

where
op = time of time series
cfpath = config file path
ovcfpath = overriding config file path
nplots = no of plot for data generated (-1 for no plot)

Generate normal data for prediction
Make sure window size is window.size is 10000 or more
Run
python3 tsgend.py --op motif  --cfpath tsgen_test.properties --ovcfpath tsgen_ecg.properties --nplots 4 > ecgn.csv

Add anomaly to data for prediction
Run
python3 tsgend.py --op insan  --cfpath tsgen_test.properties --ovcfpath tsgen_ecg.properties --dfpath ecgn.csv  --prec 3 --nplots 4 > ecgp.csv

Build the model of state transition probability matrix
======================================================
Run
python3 tsanod.py --op mcm --cfpath tsano_mc_ecg.properties
Make sure model got saved in the path specified with train.model.file

Detect anomaly
==============
Run
python3 tsanod.py --op mcp --cfpath tsano_mc_ecg.properties

You can plot anomaly score. Values below thehold specified in pred.ano.threshold are anomalous sequences
Run
python3 tsanod.py --op plot --dfpath ecga.csv --nplots 5
