This tutorial is  for synthetic time series data generation. Although the module tsgen in the pyton 
package zaman can generate different kinds of time series, this tutorial is for generation of time series
with trend, seasonality and gaussian noise

Setup
=====
Install the package zaman
pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ zaman==0.0.2

For local build and istallation run this from the repo root directory whakapi
./lbi.sh zaman

Install dependencies, by running this from the package root directory
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Configuration
=============
Use tsgen_test.properties as is. You edit to meet your needs e.g using day seasonality instead 
of wee or the change the the rate of linear trend. The document zaman/docs/tsgen_config_readme.txt explains 
all config parameters and how to use them

Generate time series
====================
tsgend.py --op tsn  --cfpath tsgen_test.properties > tsn.cv

where
op = time series type
cfpath = config file path

Insert anomalous sequence
=========================
tsgend.py --op insan  --cfpath tsgen_test.properties  --dfpath tsn.cv --prec 2 > tsna.csv

where
op = "insan" for inserting anomalous sequence
cfpath = config file path
dfpath = path to file generated in the previous step
prec  = floating point precision in output
