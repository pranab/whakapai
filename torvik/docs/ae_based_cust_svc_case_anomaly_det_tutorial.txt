This tutorial is for anaomaly detection for service time for an issue processing system  data using 
auto encoder. 
 

Setup
=====
Install matumizi which is a package for data exploration and various other utilities
pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ matumizi==0.0.1

Install no code framework for PyTorch
pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ torvik==0.0.2

it's recommended that you copy ticket.py  and ae_ticket.properties to a working directory and work 
from there. You should create directory called model under your working directory


Create normal data for modeling
===============================
./ticket.py genx <num_issues> > cus_tr.txt

where
num_issues = number of issues e.g 2000


Create test data
================
./ticket.py genx <num_issues> > cus.txt
where
num_issues = number of issues e.g 200

insert outliers
/ticket.py iolx  cus.txt <outlier_percentage> > cus_te.txt

where
<outlier_percentage = outlier percentage e.g 10

Train Auto Encoder
==================
 ./ticket.py train  ae_ticket.properties
 Make sure the following are set
 train.model.save=True
 
 Model hyper parameters are tuned manually. Feel free to change and experiment by editing the file
 ae_ticket.properties
 
 Test for regeneration error
 ===========================
 ./ticket.py regen ae_ticket.properties
 A file called rol.txt has the output
