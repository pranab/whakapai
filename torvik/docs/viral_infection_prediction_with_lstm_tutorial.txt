This tutorial is for viral infection prediction with LSTM using PyTorch

Setup
=====
Install matumizi which is a package for data exploration and various other utilities
pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ matumizi==0.0.1

Install no code framework for PyTorch
pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ torvik==0.0.2

it's recommended that you copy ctrace.py  and lstm_ct.properties to a working directory and work 
from there.Â You should create directory called model under your working directory


Generate Data
=============
-training data 
./ctrace.py simu <num_rec>  y > ctr_tr.txt
num_rec = number of records e.f if you choose 5000, tere will be 1000 sequence records
because sequence is composed of 5 records

-validation data 
./ctrace.py simu <num_rec> y > ctr_va.txt

-prediction data
./ctrace.py simu <num_rec> n > ctr_pr.txt
The 3rd command line argument is n, which means target value won't be generated
since this data will be used for prediction

Train model
===========
./ctrace.py train lstm_ct.properties

The trained model could be saved by setting these parameters as follows
common.model.directory=./model/lstm
common.model.file=ctr.mod
train.model.save=True

Predict
=======
./ctrace.py pred  lstm_ct.properties

The saved model could be used for prediction by setting this configuration parameter
predict.use.saved.model=True

Type of prediction (binary or probability) can be selected with this parameter
predict.output=prob
