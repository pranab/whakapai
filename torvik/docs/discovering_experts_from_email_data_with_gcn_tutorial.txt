This tutorial is fora Graph Convolution Neural Network(GCN) for predicting categories employees in 
an organization using email data. It uses a no code framework based on PyTorch.

Setup
=====
Install matumizi which is a package for data exploration and various other utilities
pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ matumizi==0.0.1


Install node framework for PyTorch
pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ torvik==0.0.2

it's recommended that you copy emcom.py  and gcn_em.properties to a working directory and work 
from there. You should create directory called model under your working directory

Generate data
=============
./emcom.py --op gen --nemp 1000 --nexp 200 --njun 300 --nclust 3 --nsm 1 --trsz 500 > em.txt

where 
no of employeess = 1000
no of experts = 200
no of juniors = 300
no of clusters = 3
no of subject matters = 1
training data size = 500

Feel free to change them

Train GCN model
===============
./emcom.py --op train --cfile gcn_em.properties

Make predictions
================
./emcom.py --op pred --cfile gcn_em.properties
